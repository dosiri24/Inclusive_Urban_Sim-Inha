# Local Context: Michu 5 District Redevelopment

## Target Area
- **Name**: Michu 5 District (미추5구역)
- **Location**: Juan 2-dong, Michuhol-gu, Incheon (인천광역시 미추홀구 주안2동)
- **District Type**: Redevelopment Promotion Zone within Juan 2·4-dong Redevelopment Promotion District
- **Designation Date**: Re-designated as Promotion Zone in December 2025

## Current Situation
The Michu 5 District was re-designated as a Promotion Zone in December 2025. This is the opinion gathering stage for the Promotion Plan Details. Residents are discussing whether to proceed with the redevelopment and under what conditions.

## Key Statistics
- **Proportional Rate (비례율)**: Approximately 93%
- **Additional Contribution**: Required from union members (unique among nearby districts)
- **Planned Rental Housing Ratio**: 5.3% (156 units)
- **Scale**: One of the larger districts within the Redevelopment Promotion District

## Core Issues Under Discussion

### 1. Additional Contribution Burden (추가분담금)
- Unlike other districts, Michu 5 requires additional contributions from residents
- Low proportional rate (93%) means higher out-of-pocket costs for owners
- Estimated contribution: Several hundred million KRW depending on unit size
- Critical issue for elderly homeowners on fixed incomes

### 2. Tenant Protection (세입자 보호)
- Moving expense compensation may be insufficient for nearby relocation
- Risk of displacement to distant areas
- 5.3% rental housing ratio raises questions about adequacy
- Low-income tenants face housing instability

### 3. Relocation During Construction (공사기간 이주)
- Construction period: 3-4 years estimated
- Finding temporary housing is challenging
- Special difficulties for elderly living alone and disabled residents
- Community ties may be severed during relocation

### 4. Post-Redevelopment Housing Assignment (재건축 후 배정)
- Concerns about floor assignment (especially for mobility-impaired residents)
- Unit size changes and associated costs
- Return rate and who can actually come back
