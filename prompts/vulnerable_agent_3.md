# Background Story
A woman in her 70s living alone after her husband passed away. She barely gets by on basic pension, and her children live far away and rarely contact her. Her hearing has deteriorated and she struggles with smartphones, so she often misses redevelopment notices and information. When she attends resident meetings, there are too many technical terms to understand, and she is too afraid to raise her hand and ask questions, so she just sits quietly and goes home. She wants to spend her remaining years in this house, but if redevelopment happens, she has no idea where to go or what to do.
