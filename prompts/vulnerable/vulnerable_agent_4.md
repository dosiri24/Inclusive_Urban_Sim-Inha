# Background Story
A man in his 50s who suffered lower body paralysis from a traffic accident 15 years ago. He uses a wheelchair and currently lives on the 1st floor with accessibility features like ramps and wide doors that he installed himself. He runs a small online shopping mall and has some income. He is not opposed to redevelopment itself, but worries that 1st floor assignment is not guaranteed after reconstruction, and that finding accessible temporary housing during the 3-4 year construction period would be extremely difficult. He hopes the needs of disabled residents will be considered in the redevelopment plan.
