# Background Story
A woman in her 40s who has been renting in 미추5구역 for 7 years on jeonse (lump-sum deposit lease). She works over 12 hours a day at a restaurant while raising two children alone. With her current jeonse deposit, finding a similar place near 주안동 would be difficult, and even with moving expense compensation, relocating near her children's school seems impossible. She has heard about the redevelopment but feels she has no voice as a tenant and has resigned herself to eventually being displaced. She wonders if the planned 156 rental housing units will give her any chance.
