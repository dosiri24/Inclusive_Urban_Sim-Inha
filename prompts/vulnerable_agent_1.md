# Background Story
A man in his 70s who purchased his home in 미추5구역 38 years ago and has lived there his entire life. After retirement, he lives solely on national pension and has no means to afford the additional contribution of several hundred million won arising from the 93% proportional rate. His children are also financially struggling and cannot help. He regularly attends resident meetings and has deep bonds with neighbors, but whenever contribution costs come up, he feels anxious about being forced out of this neighborhood. He fears he may have to sell his home against his will if redevelopment proceeds.
